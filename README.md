# Classic Tetris

Frameless experiment game based on the classic tetris from the nes.

Available features:

* Survival Mode

* Levels: increment speed of falling pieces until level 30, from 1000ms (level 1) to 70ms (level 30+)

* Efficient score counting: only check the current piece vertical length (min 1 row, max 4 rows)

* Combo count and rewards: back to back tetris is well rewarded

* Random pieces: batch of 7 pieces, with zszs combinations not allowed

Upcoming:

* Better menues handling: elements should not be created on the js side

* Indexed database to keep track of the best 5 scores and biggest back to back combo

* Indexed database to change controls on pc

* Grace time on bottom: pieces should have a fixed time to be locked at bottom, that allows rotations and small movements

* Better way to check for null elements

**It is mobile compatible!**
